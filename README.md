# Vervit

This repository contains source code to the **Vervit** mobile application, developed for a student non-profit [organization](https://vervit.cz) providing technological support to senior citizens in the Czech Republic.

We developed the app using the Flutter UI Toolkit and successfully deployed it on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vervit/id1586873318) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vervit.vervit_app).
